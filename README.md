Pandas Homework

In this repo I have a Homework assigment where I analyzed data for a fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
In this game users can play for free but are ncouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience.
The goal is to be able to come out with some meaningful insights after analyzing this games purchase data.

The repo includes:
- The original file with the purchasing data,
- The Jupyter Notebook
- A summary of my conclusions following the analysis performed
